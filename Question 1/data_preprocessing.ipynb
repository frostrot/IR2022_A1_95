      " The BBS known as APSNET (Aurora Public Schools Net) was the creation\n",
      " of Glenn Blanco, Andy Yuan and Gary Sleap.  It was a Master's Degree\n",
      " project that came online in the fall of 1985.  The BBS (Bulletin Board\n",
      " Service) came online at Columbia Middle School in Aurora.  The\n",
      " equipment used was an Apple IIe with a 20-megabyte hard drive.  It\n",
      " used the GBBS Pro software package, which was the standard for Apple\n",
      " BBS software in the 1980s.  APSNET was named by David Ladek, then an\n",
      " 8th grade student at Columbia.\n",
      " \n",
      " APSNET was online from the fall of 1985 until the fall of 1994.  In\n",
      " its ten-year history, the BBS, with only one phone line (303-693-6737)\n",
      " was averaging over 40 calls per day and well over one thousand calls\n",
      " per month.  After 10 years, the final log of calls was well over one\n",
      " hundred thousand.  During APSNET's tenure, thousands of users\n",
      " logged-in from all over the state of Colorado.  APSNET even received\n",
      " long distance contact from a former user who was in the armed forces\n",
      " serving in Germany.  APSNET was responsible for at least one marriage.\n",
      "  Sysops received thanks from a user who met his partner while\n",
      " exchanging e-mail on the system.\n",
      " \n",
      " APSNET featured electronic mail, bulletin board posting, online USA\n",
      " Today News Service and a full menu of online games and simulations as\n",
      " well as educational downloads.  The APSNET BBS was the first\n",
      " electronic mail service for the Aurora Public Schools.  Most of the\n",
      " users of APSNET were students from schools around the Denver Metro\n",
      " area.  Several teachers used the service on a regular basis.\n",
      " \n",
      " APSNET began with a baud rate of 500 bps in 1985 and progressed\n",
      " through 1200, 2400 and then 9600 bps in 1988.  It was recognized as\n",

      " APSNET endured as a successful BBS because of direct support for the\n",
